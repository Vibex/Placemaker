# placemaker

placemaker is a powerful wrapper for wmutils. It is designed to simlify the process of managing windows and allow users to easily create tiling/stacking patterns. 

## Requirements
* wmutils/core
* wmutils/opt

## todo
* Add detailed documentation to this readme (though the --help and --more-help commands can help for now)
* Add support for WM like berry that don't always work well with wmutils.
* Add example patterns to allow users to jumpstart their own patterns.
